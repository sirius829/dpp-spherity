# Digital Product Passport - Front-End Challenge

Welcome to the **Digital Product Passport** front-end challenge! This project is designed to demonstrate your ability to build a dynamic and interactive web interface. You will be working with real data from an API to present verifiable credentials for a car battery.

## Objective

The task is to create a dynamic, interactive front-end page that fetches, processes, and presents data about a car battery from a provided API. The goal is to showcase your skills in data handling, component design, and building responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

## Challenge Details

### API Endpoint: Digital Product Passport Data

The data provided contains verifiable credentials about a car battery. You will need to fetch this data from the API, process it, and present it in an organized and structured way.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Data Handling
- Fetch data from the provided API.
- Handle errors effectively, such as network failures or invalid responses.
- Process the data to display essential information (e.g., battery specifications, scores, etc.).

### 2. Dynamic Interface
- Build interactive components to display the data:
  - **Expandable sections**: Display sections that can be expanded or collapsed (e.g., product specifications, performance data).
  - **Filtering options**: Allow users to filter the data (e.g., filter by product category or by score).
  - **Sortable tables**: Allow users to sort performance or specification data dynamically.
- Ensure a seamless user experience when interacting with the components.

### 3. Focus on Functionality
- The primary focus is on **functionality** rather than design. However, the UI should still be clean and easy to navigate.
- Ensure the page is **responsive** and works well on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

### 4. Interactivity
Implement interactive elements such as:
- **Filters** for specific data fields (e.g., filter by product specifications).
- **Search functionality** to allow users to quickly navigate to relevant sections.
- **Charts or tables** that provide users with the ability to explore data in a dynamic way.

### 5. Bonus Features (Optional)
- Add innovative ways to **visualize complex data** for better user understanding.
- Implement features like **real-time data updates** or additional pages for detailed insights.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. **Data Handling and API Integration**
- How well is the data fetched, processed, and presented?
- Are errors handled appropriately and gracefully?

### 2. **Component Design and Reusability**
- Are the components modular, reusable, and logically organized?
- Is the code structure clean and maintainable?

### 3. **UI Usability and Responsiveness**
- Does the UI provide a user-friendly experience?
- Is the application responsive and well-suited for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)?

### 4. **Code Quality**
- Is the code clean, well-documented, and maintainable?
- Are best practices followed in terms of coding standards?

### 5. **Creativity and Extra Effort**
- Have you implemented any additional features or design elements that improve the projectâ€™s user experience or functionality?
- Do you bring innovation to the way the data is visualized or interacted with?
